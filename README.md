## 📚 Featured Projects

### 🎯 [Object-Oriented Learning Journey](https://github.com/andreas-wagner-dev/object-oriented-learning-journey)
A curated collection of my favorite blogs and resources from experts who teach the real ideas behind object-oriented software development. Perfect for developers wanting to deepen their OOP understanding.

**Why this matters:** Understanding OOP isn't just about syntax—it's about a programming philosophy that changes how we think about problems and design solutions.

### ⚡ [Kafka Server Embedded](https://github.com/andreas-wagner-dev/kafka-server-embedded)
Complete example of running an embedded Kafka server as a local Java program, including producer and consumer examples in JUnit tests.

**Key Features:**
- Easy local development setup
- Production-ready patterns
- Comprehensive test examples

## 🌱 What I'm Currently Learning
- Advanced Kafka patterns and streaming architectures
- Modern Java features and best practices
- Microservices design patterns

## 💡 Philosophy
I believe in:
- **Clean Code:** Writing code that tells a story
- **Continuous Learning:** Technology evolves, and so should we
- **Knowledge Sharing:** The best way to learn is to teach others
